# Once upon a time...

So, a long time ago (>25 years) I decided to learn web programming and make a game based on a dearly missed genre of [BBS door](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door_(bulletin_board_system) [games](https://breakintochat.com/wiki/BBS_door_game) - [Trade Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_Wars) games ([TW2002](https://breakintochat.com/wiki/TradeWars_2002), [Ultimate Universe](https://breakintochat.com/wiki/Ultimate_Universe), [Galactic Warzone](https://www.smbaker.com/games/galactic-warzone), [Yankee Trader](https://breakintochat.com/wiki/Yankee_Trader)... the list goes on).

The result was [BlackNova Traders](https://sourceforge.net/projects/blacknova/).  I created some hideous code in PHP3 with a MySQL backend. Looking at my original code now is akin to someone looking at poetry they wrote in high school - nostalgic and cringe inducing.

Now, I've learnt a few things over the years (one would hope) and I've decided to refresh the game concept.  Using the latest PHP (as of this writing 8.4) and a lean [framework](https://docs.flightphp.com/?lang=en) and [orm](https://docs.flightphp.com/awesome-plugins/active-record) - I'm writing (hopefully) less hideous and cringe worth code as a [RESTful API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST) to serve as a back end to any game client.  

I plan on writing a couple of basic clients - including a terminal interface style client - but I will publish the full API when done so that others can write their own clients (and yes, bots - but don't worry, that's gonna be okay, I have plans!) to suit their own needs.

Right now, this is a work in progress.  Life, work, school (yes, I'm a "life-long learner" or possibly some sort of masochist) will get in the way at different points but I hope to make progress when I can.  I also invite community contributions - which I reserve the right to include or not, as I see fit.
